        <center><h2>Instruction~</h2></center>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough starts to form.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat up.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. Spread half of the pizza sauce evenly over each dough round, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half of the shredded mozzarella cheese over each pizza crust, then add your desired toppings.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the pizzas (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizzas from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before slicing. </li>
        </ol>
