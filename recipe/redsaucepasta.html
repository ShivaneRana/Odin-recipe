        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta according to the package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain the cooked pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion, and saut√© until the onion is soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and tomato paste. Mix well until the tomato paste is fully incorporated into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add the dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Allow the sauce to simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly and the flavors meld together. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to adjust the consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce is ready, add the cooked pasta to the skillet. Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Serve:</h3>
