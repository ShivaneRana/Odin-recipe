        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the patties: In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and minced garlic. Mix well using your hands until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Be careful not to overwork the meat, as this can make the burgers tough.</li>
            
            <li>Form the patties: Divide the meat mixture into equal portions, depending on how large you want your burgers to be. Use your hands to shape each portion into a patty, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Press down gently in the center of each patty to prevent them from bulging when cooking.</li>
            
            <li>Cook the patties: Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the patties and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness, or adjust cooking time according to your preference for doneness. If using a skillet, you may need to cook in batches depending on its size.</li>
            
            <li>Prepare the buns: While the patties are cooking, slice the hamburger buns in half and lightly toast them on the grill or in a toaster. This helps to prevent the buns from becoming soggy when assembled with the cooked patties.</li>
            
            <li>Assemble the burgers: Place a cooked patty on the bottom half of each bun. Top with cheese slices, lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, onions, pickles, and any other desired toppings. Spread condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) on the top half of the buns.</li>
            
            <li>Serve: Place the top half of the bun over the toppings to complete the burgers. Serve immediately while hot, and enjoy!</li>
