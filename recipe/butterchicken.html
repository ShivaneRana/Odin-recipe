            Butter chicken, also known as murgh makhani, is a popular Indian dish renowned for its rich and creamy texture and flavorful taste. Originating from North India, particularly Punjab, it consists of tender pieces of chicken marinated in a spiced yogurt mixture, cooked in a creamy tomato-based sauce infused with butter, cream, and various aromatic spices such as garam masala, cumin, coriander, and fenugreek. The dish is typically served with naan bread or rice, making it a beloved comfort food both in India and internationally. Its harmonious blend of spices and creamy sauce has made it a favorite among enthusiasts of Indian cuisine worldwide.

        <center><h2>Instructions~</h2></center>  

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, turmeric, paprika, chili powder, minced garlic, minced ginger, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight for the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top.</li>
            <li>Arrange the marinated chicken pieces on the wire rack and bake for 20-25 minutes or until cooked through. You can also grill or cook the chicken in a skillet if preferred. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter with vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger to the skillet and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and paprika. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the spices are toasted and aromatic.</li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato puree and bring the mixture to a simmer. Allow it to cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Add salt to taste and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce, stirring gently to coat each piece with the sauce. Simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through.</li>
            </ol>
